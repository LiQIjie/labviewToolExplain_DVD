Windows API Utilities.

An eclectic set of wrapper VIs around some windows API functions.

I wrote these many years ago (1998? wow!) but have used them to some extent
in virtually all my windows programs.

I've included all the original functions (accidentally re-compiled under LV 9.0) and
just wrapped them up in a project and added the LAVA required stuff.

Many functions have been superseded by LabView functions and I expect many people
already have their own. But there are still some gems I couldn't do without
and maybe someone will find them useful.

Installation:
Unzip to a directory of your choice.

Required Packages:
Labview 9.0 or greater.
Windows XP or greater (may work on earlier versions)

Known Issues.
None.

Versioning:
Current version 1.0.
