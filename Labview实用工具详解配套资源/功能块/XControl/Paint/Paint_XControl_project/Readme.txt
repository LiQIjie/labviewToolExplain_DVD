This XControl demonstrates using some of the picture functions available in LabVIEW in an XControl. The end result is a control that allows the user to paint objects such as lines, circles and text into a picture control. The output of the picture control is the painted image.

Open Paint Demo.vi to see an example of how this XControl can be used.

The user also has the option to undo the last action, clear the image, insert a bitmap file into the image, or save the image to a bitmap file. Right click the picture control for these options.
