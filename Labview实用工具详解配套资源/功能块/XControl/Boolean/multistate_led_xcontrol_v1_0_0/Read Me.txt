Background:
I have had many people ask for an LED type indicator for their project. During development, I often get asked to have this Boolean (ie 2 state) indicator display one of (more than 2) colours. 
Whilst that in itself is not difficult, more often than not I am then asked to make the Boolean LED flash as well to highlight certain states. 
For example a single LED will often need to indicate the following states:
OFF (green, red or grey)
ON (Green, red or grey)
Flashing (green, red, any other colour)
I have had so much demand for this functionality, that I decided to develop this XControl and share it with the LabVIEW Community.
Many thanks must go to Aristos Queue and his inspiring "Scrolling LED XControl" example.

Distribution:
This code was downloaded from the LAVA Code Repository: http://forums.lavag.org/downloads.html

Description:
This XControl is a typical Boolean LED indicator that can also be configured to flash between two user defined colours. The flashing interval can also be modified.
When not flashing, the XControl behaves as a normal Boolean LED. 
This XControl is an indicator only is is not intended to be used as a control.

Dependancies:
There are no OpenG dependencies for this XCtonrol

Known Issues:
If you save this code for version 8.0/8.2, you may encounter issues trying to assign multiple properties in one property node. 
This is a bug in LabVIEW 8.0/8.2
